7. the benefit of class give us: class is power user-define data type, sort of an extra date type 
8. public keyword is an access modifier that we use here to determine what access we want to allow others to have to this new class that we are creating ( allow accesses without being restricted)
9. using private that is no other class can access that class, protected which allows allows classes in thos package to access your class and you can also remove the access modifier completely if you prefer.
